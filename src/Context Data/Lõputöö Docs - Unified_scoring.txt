Unified Cyber Hygiene Score Calculation
Step 1: Calculate Individual Scores
Each questionnaire generates a separate score:
1. Organizational Cyber Hygiene Score (OCHS) → Based on the organizational questionnaire.
2. Employee Cyber Hygiene Score (ECHS) → Based on the employee questionnaire (average of all employee responses).
Both are rated on a 0-100 scale.

Step 2: Weighting the Scores
We need to determine how much weight to give each score. Possible approaches:
Option
	Organizational Score Weight
	Employee Score Weight
	Best Use Case
	Equal Weighting
	50%
	50%
	Balanced view of both technical and human factors.
	Heavier Org Focus
	70%
	30%
	If technical security is prioritized over behavior.
	Heavier Employee Focus
	40%
	60%
	If human risk is the main concern.
	Recommended Default: 50% Organizational / 50% Employee for a balanced perspective.
Formula:
Unified Cyber Hygiene Score (UCHS)=(OCHS×0.5)+(ECHS×0.5)\text{Unified Cyber Hygiene Score (UCHS)} = (OCHS \times 0.5) + (ECHS \times 0.5)Unified Cyber Hygiene Score (UCHS)=(OCHS×0.5)+(ECHS×0.5)

Step 3: Interpreting the Final Score
Final Score (%)
	Cyber Hygiene Level
	90 – 100
	Excellent (Highly secure and aware organization)
	75 – 89
	Strong (Good security policies and employee awareness)
	50 – 74
	Moderate (Some security gaps or behavioral risks)
	25 – 49
	Weak (Significant cybersecurity weaknesses, urgent improvements needed)
	0 – 24
	Critical (Severe risks from both technical and human factors)

Step 4: Cyber Hygiene Report & Insights
Each organization would receive a report that includes:
1. Overall Cyber Hygiene Score (Unified Score)
2. Breakdown of Scores:
   * Organizational Cyber Hygiene Score (OCHS)
   * Employee Cyber Hygiene Score (ECHS)
3. Category-Specific Strengths & Weaknesses
4. Risk-Based Recommendations (Technical improvements & training needs)
5. Comparison to Industry/National Averages


3. Unified Cyber Hygiene Score (Organization + Employees)
To get a holistic view of an organization’s cyber hygiene, the organization-level and employee-level scores can be combined.
Component
	Weight (%)
	Organization Cyber Hygiene Score
	60%
	Employee Cyber Hygiene Score (Average of all employees)
	40%
	Example Calculation
* Organization Score = 74.4%
* Average Employee Score = 67.3%
Unified Cyber Hygiene Score
= (74.4% × 60%) + (67.3% × 40%)
= 71.7% (Moderate to Strong Cyber Hygiene - Some Improvements Needed)
Estonia Level
3. Unified Cyber Hygiene Score (Organization + Employees)
To provide a holistic view of an organization's cybersecurity hygiene:
Component
	Weight (%)
	Rationale
	Organization Cyber Hygiene Score
	65%
	Organizational security is more impactful than individual awareness.
	Employee Cyber Hygiene Score (Avg.)
	35%
	Employees remain a major vulnerability but are secondary to infrastructure security.
	Final Calculation (Example)
* Organization Score = 74%
* Employee Score = 67.5%
Unified Cyber Hygiene Score = (74 × 65%) + (67.5 × 35%)
= 71.7% (Moderate to Strong - Needs Some Improvements)
