1. Scoring System for Employees
Each question is rated from 0 to 4, following the same scale as the organizational questionnaire:
Score
	Employee Cyber Hygiene Level
	0
	Not Practiced (Unaware or ignores security practices)
	1
	Weak (Minimal cybersecurity knowledge, risky behavior)
	2
	Moderate (Some awareness, but inconsistent practices)
	3
	Strong (Mostly follows best practices, occasional lapses)
	4
	Excellent (Fully aware and follows best practices consistently)
	The overall employee cyber hygiene score is calculated by averaging responses.
Interpreting Employee Cyber Hygiene Score
Final Score (%)
	Cyber Hygiene Level
	90 – 100
	Excellent (Security-conscious workforce)
	75 – 89
	Strong (Most employees practice good cyber hygiene)
	50 – 74
	Moderate (Some risky behaviors, needs improvement)
	25 – 49
	Weak (Employees are unaware or untrained)
	0 – 24
	Critical (High cybersecurity risk from employee behavior)
	

2. Weighted Scoring Model for Employees
Here, the employee’s cybersecurity awareness and habits are evaluated. Certain behaviors (like phishing awareness) are more critical than others.
Category Weights for Employees
Category
	Weight (%)
	Password & Access Management
	20%
	Phishing Awareness & Email Security
	30%
	Device & Data Security
	20%
	Remote Work & Public Network Security
	15%
	Incident Reporting & Cybersecurity Culture
	15%
	Example Calculation for Employees
1. Each category consists of multiple questions (0–4 points each).
2. Category Score = (Total score of all questions in that category) / (Max possible score).
3. Final Employee Cyber Hygiene Score = Sum of (Category Score × Category Weight) across all categories.
Example Calculation (Simplified)
* Password & Access Management: (Total Score: 14 / Max: 16) → 87.5%
* Phishing Awareness & Email Security: (Total Score: 10 / Max: 20) → 50%
* Device & Data Security: (Total Score: 12 / Max: 16) → 75%
* Remote Work & Public Network Security: (Total Score: 10 / Max: 12) → 83.3%
* Incident Reporting & Cybersecurity Culture: (Total Score: 9 / Max: 16) → 56.3%
Final Employee Cyber Hygiene Score
= (87.5% × 20%) + (50% × 30%) + (75% × 20%) + (83.3% × 15%) + (56.3% × 15%)
= 67.3% (Moderate Cyber Hygiene - Needs Improvement)
Estonia Level
2. Employee-Level Cyber Hygiene Weights (Estonia-Aligned)
Category
	Weight (%)
	Rationale (Estonian Context)
	Password & Access Management
	20%
	Estonian digital identity (eID, Mobile-ID) requires strong authentication security.
	Phishing Awareness & Email Security
	35%
	Social engineering is one of the biggest cyber threats. Estonia sees increasing phishing attacks.
	Device & Data Security
	15%
	Protection of government-issued workstations and personal devices.
	Remote Work & Public Network Security
	10%
	Estonia has strong digital work culture, but securing remote work is still a challenge.
	Incident Reporting & Cybersecurity Culture
	20%
	Encouraging employees to actively report incidents strengthens national cybersecurity resilience.
	* Phishing Awareness gets the highest weight (35%) due to Estonia’s vulnerability to phishing attacks and misinformation campaigns.
* Incident Reporting is emphasized (20%) because Estonia promotes a cyber-aware culture where employees play a key role in reporting threats.
Final Employee Score Calculation (Example)
* Password & Access Management: 85% → (85 × 20%) = 17%
* Phishing Awareness & Email Security: 60% → (60 × 35%) = 21%
* Device & Data Security: 70% → (70 × 15%) = 10.5%
* Remote Work & Public Network Security: 90% → (90 × 10%) = 9%
* Incident Reporting & Cybersecurity Culture: 50% → (50 × 20%) = 10%
Total Employee Cyber Hygiene Score = 67.5% (Moderate - Needs Improvement)
