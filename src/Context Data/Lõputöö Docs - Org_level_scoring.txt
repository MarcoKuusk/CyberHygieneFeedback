1. Scorecard Structure
The scorecard will consist of key cybersecurity categories, each containing specific assessment criteria. Organizations will be assigned a score for each category, leading to an overall cyber hygiene rating.
Proposed Scoring Model
* 0 – Non-existent: No cybersecurity measures in place.
* 1 – Weak: Basic cybersecurity measures exist but are incomplete or ineffective.
* 2 – Moderate: Some good practices are followed, but there are gaps.
* 3 – Strong: Most cybersecurity measures are implemented correctly.
* 4 – Excellent: Full compliance with best practices and continuous improvement.
Scoring System Implementation
* Each question within a category is assigned a score from 0 to 4 based on implementation level.
* The total category score is calculated as an average of its individual criteria.
* The final cyber hygiene score is a weighted sum of all category scores, resulting in a percentage.
Scoring Interpretation
Final Score (%)
	Cyber Hygiene Level
	90 – 100
	Excellent (Highly secure, proactive cybersecurity measures in place)
	75 – 89
	Strong (Most key security practices implemented, minor improvements needed)
	50 – 74
	Moderate (Some security gaps, needs improvement)
	25 – 49
	Weak (Significant security risks, urgent action required)
	0 – 24
	Critical (Highly vulnerable to cyber threats)
	



2. Self-Assessment Questionnaire Method
This method involves organizations completing a structured questionnaire that evaluates their cybersecurity posture. The questionnaire consists of multiple-choice or rating-based questions that align with the scorecard categories.
Assessment Structure
Each question corresponds to a specific cybersecurity measure and is rated on a 0-4 scale, indicating the level of implementation.
Score
	Implementation Level
	0
	Not Implemented
	1
	Partially Implemented (Minimal compliance)
	2
	In Progress (Some controls exist but are not fully enforced)
	3
	Mostly Implemented (Controls are present but need improvements)
	4
	Fully Implemented (Best practices followed, continuously monitored)
	3. Weighted Scoring Model for Organizations
Each category receives a weight (%) based on its importance in cybersecurity. Then, each question within a category contributes to that category’s total score.
Category Weights for Organizations
Category
	Weight (%)
	Identity & Access Management
	20%
	Incident Response & Business Continuity
	25%
	Endpoint & Network Security
	15%
	Employee Awareness & Training
	20%
	Data Protection & Compliance
	20%
	Example Calculation for Organizations
1. Each category has multiple questions, each worth 0–4 points.
2. Category Score = (Sum of all question scores in the category) / (Max possible score in that category).
3. Final Organization Cyber Hygiene Score = Sum of (Category Score × Category Weight) across all categories.
Example Calculation (Simplified)
* Identity & Access Management: (Total Score: 12 / Max: 16) → 75%
* Incident Response & Business Continuity: (Total Score: 15 / Max: 20) → 75%
* Endpoint & Network Security: (Total Score: 10 / Max: 16) → 62.5%
* Employee Awareness & Training: (Total Score: 10 / Max: 16) → 62.5%
* Data Protection & Compliance: (Total Score: 14 / Max: 16) → 87.5%
Final Organization Cyber Hygiene Score
= (75% × 20%) + (75% × 25%) + (62.5% × 15%) + (62.5% × 20%) + (87.5% × 20%)
= 74.4% (Moderate to Strong Cyber Hygiene)


Estonia Level
1. Organization-Level Cyber Hygiene Weights (Estonia-Aligned)
Category
	Weight (%)
	Rationale (Estonian Context)
	Identity & Access Management
	25%
	Estonia heavily relies on digital identity (eID, Mobile-ID, Smart-ID). Secure authentication and access control are critical.
	Incident Response & Business Continuity
	30%
	Estonia faces frequent cyber threats (e.g., state-sponsored attacks). Strong incident response & continuity planning is a high priority.
	Endpoint & Network Security
	15%
	Protection of government & corporate networks is essential but more standardized.
	Employee Awareness & Training
	20%
	Human error is a major cybersecurity risk. Estonia emphasizes awareness training (e.g., CERT-EE initiatives).
	Data Protection & Compliance (GDPR, NIS2, ISKE)
	10%
	Compliance is necessary but less impactful than active security measures.
	* Higher weight on Identity & Access Management due to Estonia’s reliance on digital IDs.
* Stronger focus on Incident Response due to Estonia’s history of cyberattacks (e.g., 2007 cyberwarfare incident).
Final Organization Score Calculation (Example)
* Identity & Access Management: 80% → (80 × 25%) = 20%
* Incident Response & Business Continuity: 70% → (70 × 30%) = 21%
* Endpoint & Network Security: 60% → (60 × 15%) = 9%
* Employee Awareness & Training: 75% → (75 × 20%) = 15%
* Data Protection & Compliance: 90% → (90 × 10%) = 9%
Total Organization Cyber Hygiene Score = 74% (Moderate to Strong Security Level)
